# Forest Escape

You are a forest ninja trying to escape from the big Troll boss! Traverse through one level of the forest, filled with enemies (worms and slimes), power-ups (apples will speed you up!), and collect coins to increase your score. You will face off with the Troll boss in the second level of this game, where you must jump on his head 6 times to win. But be careful- with each life the boss loses, the faster he moves. 

You will start off with 3 lives. Move your ninja with the arrow keys, and jump with space bar. You will automatically be moved to the boss level once you touch the door at the end of the platform level. If you lose all 3 lives, or run out of time, your game will be over. You can press "P" to return to the main menu at any time.
